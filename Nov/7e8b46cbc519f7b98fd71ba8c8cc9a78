Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang has been officially sworn in by president of The Gambia, Adama Barrow, as his vice president amidst age controversy. At 64, the “Mother of the Gambian struggle” as affectionately called, was reported to have exceeded the age limit to hold the vice-presidential position and was alleged to have reviewed her age downwards. She was deemed constitutionally ineligible to be vice-president. According to section 62(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Gambia, the Vice-President must meet the same age requirement as the President, establishing a maximum age of 65 at the time of entering the office – whereas Tambajang was reported to be 67 at the time of her selection. Early this year, Freedom paper, published an official evidence from the Gambian Tax office showing the Vice President’s date of birth as October 22, 1949. (An evidence showing, she is indeed above 65 years of age as she said). The evidence published by the paper was sourced from Mrs. Tambajang’s Tax Identification Number Card. Tambajang, the former minister under the deposed dictator, Mr. Yahaya Jammeh who previously worked as an international civil servant was described by president Barrow as ‘a woman with wealth of experience highly required for rebuilding the New Gambia’. However, local media reports indicate that the necessary legal rectifications were done for her to occupy the post as photos from the presidency showed Barrow handing her a legal document after which she is seen appending her signature to a register.
