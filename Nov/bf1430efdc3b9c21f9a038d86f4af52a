Leading successor and Vice-President to President Mugabe, Mnangagwa has been sacked. Announcing the dismissal, Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo said Mnangagwa had exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect and deceitfulness. At first, Mugabe hinted this when speaking at a rally in Shona in the opposition stronghold city of Bulawayo where his wife Grace was booed by some in the crowd. “We are denigrated and insulted in the name of Mnangagwa. Did I make a mistake in appointing him as my deputy?” Mugabe asked, “If I made a mistake by appointing Mnangagwa tell me, I will drop him as early as tomorrow. We are not afraid of anyone. We can decide even here,” he said. Mnangagwa has been accused by Mugabe loyalists of undermining the president and of fanning factionalism in ZANU-PF, which has already named the incumbent as its candidate for next year’s presidential election. Earlier on Mugabe’s wife, Grace had called on her husband to remove Mnangagwa and his removal makes it more likely that Grace will succeed her husband as vice. In October, The Nerve Africa reported Zimbabwe’s ruling party’s, Zanu-PF plans to amend its party constitution to accommodate first lady- Grace as the country’s next vice president. Its seems Mugabe’s supporters are successfully executing their plan. Last month, Mnangagwa was stripped of his role as justice minister, in a cabinet reshuffle widely speculated as part of a campaign to reduce his powers and quash opposition within the government. The first lady had previously denied any intention of running for the vice presidential seat but during the rally where she was heckled at, Grace responded saying,“If you have been paid to boo me, boo, go ahead…I don’t care, I am powerful. Even if I become vice president, is there anything wrong with that?” As she repeated her ambition to be appointed her husband’s deputy.
