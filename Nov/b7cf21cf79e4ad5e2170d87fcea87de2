Liberia’s Supreme Court has ordered preparations for presidential run-off elections be halted, due to allegations of fraud from an opposition Charles Brumskine, third runner up from Liberty party. A run-off vote between the two candidates is scheduled for November 7 between Vice President Joseph Boakai, a member of outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s Unity Party, who won 28.8 percent of votes, against former soccer star George Weah who won 38.4 percent votes. According to Brumskine, the election held last month was “characterised by massive systematic irregularities and fraud”. Noting that the late opening of polling stations prevented people from voting. These allegations of irregularities were supported by two political parties, one of which alleged its president interfered in the process. In a statement, Unity Party Chairman Wilmont Paye, said Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf had acted inappropriately by meeting privately with elections magistrates before the vote. “Greed has resurfaced in its most callous form, sowing seeds of discord yet again with the intent of disrupting the fragile peace of Liberia”. Issue of irregularities in the first round of voting was also observed by AFP news agency, although no major concerns were raised by other international observers. The court has instructed the Liberty Party and the electoral commission to present their cases on November 2.
